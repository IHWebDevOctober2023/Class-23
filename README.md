# useContext hook

In this exercise we will learn how to use the useContext hook to pass data to components without using props.

Avoiding prop drilling is one of the main reasons to use the useContext hook. Prop drilling is the process of passing props from a component to another component that is nested deeper in the component tree. This can be a tedious process and can make the code harder to read and maintain.

In simple applications, prop drilling is not a big issue. However, as the application grows, it can become a problem. The useContext hook can help us solve this problem.
